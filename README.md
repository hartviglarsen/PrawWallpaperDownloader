# PrawPapers (Praw Wallpaper Downloader)

Download a bunch of wallpapers from the hot sections of r/wallpapers

And it doesn't even have to be wallpapers! PrawPapers will download images from any subreddit

Going into a little more detail the script will:

1. Query Reddit for an amount of posts (25 by default)
2. Sift through the reddit posts finding direct image links and imgur posts/albums
3. Extract all image links from any imgur albums found and add them to the link pool
4. Check whether any of the links has been downloaded before, sorting out those who has
5. Download all the now sorted links
6. Go through all downloaded images deleting any images less than 1280x720

The configuration mode lets you tweak almost all settings to your desire, including but not limited to:
* Default subreddit
* Minimum image dimensions
* Amound of posts to sift through
* And more
